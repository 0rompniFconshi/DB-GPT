One of the trials that showed remarkable reductions in blood pressure (BP) after renal denervation (RDN) was the ENLIGHTN-1 trial (Multicenter Sham-Controlled RCT of Renal Denervation for Hypertension). This trial used a device that had multiple electrodes and delivered radiofrequency energy to destroy the renal nerves in patients with resistant hypertension (RHT), which is a condition where BP remains high despite optimal drug therapy.119,120 The trial measured BP in different settings, such as in the clinic, at home, or with a device that recorded BP for 24 hours, and found that RDN lowered BP significantly in all of them. However, these early trials had some limitations that reduced their validity. One of them was the lack of a sham-control group, which means that there was no comparison group that received a fake procedure to account for the placebo effect. Another one was the poor adherence to drug therapy among patients with RHT, which is a common problem that affects the outcomes of treatment. Some of the trials did not monitor drug adherence, which means that they could not rule out the possibility that patients changed their behavior and took their medications more regularly because they knew they were being studied. This is known as the Hawthorne effect and it can introduce bias in the results.

To address these limitations, a larger and more rigorous trial was conducted: the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial (Renal Denervation in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension). This trial enrolled 535 patients with RHT and randomized them to either RDN or a sham procedure. The trial also used an objective method to monitor drug adherence, which was the measurement of plasma drug levels. The trial found that RDN did not lower BP significantly more than the sham procedure at 6 months of follow-up.121 This result was surprising and disappointing, as it contradicted the previous trials that showed large BP reductions after RDN.
  
Several explanations have been proposed for the negative result of the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial. Some of them are related to the design and conduct of the trial, such as the selection of patients, the variability of BP measurements, the adequacy of the RDN procedure, and the influence of drug therapy. Others are related to the biology and physiology of RDN, such as the variability of renal nerve anatomy, the degree of renal nerve injury, and the role of compensatory mechanisms.122 These factors may have affected the efficacy and safety of RDN and contributed to the heterogeneity of the results among different trials.
  
Therefore, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms and effects of RDN in patients with RHT. New trials are underway to test different devices and techniques for RDN, as well as to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit more from this procedure.123,124 Future trials should also use standardized methods to measure BP and monitor drug adherence, as well as include long-term follow-up to assess the durability and safety of RDN.125 RDN is still a promising therapy for RHT, but it requires further evaluation and optimization before it can be widely adopted in clinical practice.
